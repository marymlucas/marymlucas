- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mary Lucas
- My work and research interests lie at the intersection of healthcare and data science.  I am particularly interested in topics around predictive modelling in healthcare, algorithmic bias and fairness, and all things health data related.
- Iâ€™m currently a PhD student in Information Science at the [College of Computing and Informatics](https://drexel.edu/cci/) at Drexel University. I am also affiliated with the Health Informatics Lab at [Boston University Metropolitan College](https://www.bu.edu/met/).
- Iâ€™m always interested in collaborating on health data related projects.

- 👋 Hi, I’m Mary Lucas
- 👀 My research interests and work lie at the intersection of healthcare and data science.  I am particularly interested in topics around predictive modelling in healthcare, algorithmic bias and fairness, and really all things health data related.
- 🌱 I’m currently a PhD student in Information Science at the [College of Computing and Informatics](https://drexel.edu/cci/) at Drexel University. I am also affiliated with the Health Informatics Lab at [Boston University Metropolitan College](https://www.bu.edu/met/).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on health data science related projects.

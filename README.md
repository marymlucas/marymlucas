- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mary Lucas
- My research interests and work lie at the intersection of healthcare and data science.  I am particularly interested in topics around predictive modelling in healthcare, algorithmic bias and fairness, and really all things health data related.
- Iâ€™m currently a PhD student in Information Science at the [College of Computing and Informatics](https://drexel.edu/cci/) at Drexel University. I am also affiliated with the Health Informatics Lab at [Boston University Metropolitan College](https://www.bu.edu/met/).
- Iâ€™m always interested in collaborating on health data science related projects.
- You can also connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mary_m_lucas) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marymlucas/)
